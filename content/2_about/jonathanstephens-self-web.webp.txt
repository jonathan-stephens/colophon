Alt: I'm facing a mirror while sitting at a table with a candle beside me. My Leica camera is pointing at the mirror, as I hold it at chest height. My face is neutral, my hair is up in a messy bun. A typical brown bar setting in the Netherlands with wooden surroundings, beer bottles with the special drinks listed in the top right corner, and on the left is an open window letting in the natural light.
