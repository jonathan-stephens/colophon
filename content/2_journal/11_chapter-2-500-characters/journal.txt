Dek: My first lesson in daily writing practice, learning to write for me

----

Text:

It's been 9 days since starting this project. Better record than I've set before with any writing practice like this.

But, it's been difficult.

Extremely.

Multiple days I've arrived to the blank page equally blank, searching for something to write. I've gone to Claude, asking it to help as a writing coach. I've gone through my list of topics, content pillars, etcetera and keep coming up blank.

## I haven't been writing for myself…

The whole point of this practice is to learn to write for myself.

To create rituals of writing.

To find my rhythm.

To find my voice.

I forgot.

## Overwhelmed by advice

Every day—each networking meeting, LinkedIn post, newsletter—tends to come with advice.

“Do this to get your first customers.”

“If you're not doing that you won't find a job.”

“You're not doing this?! Idiot.”

In my writing I've been trying to write what others may consume, what they may pay me for, what devices I can offer, all the things…

Then, I lose the point.

## Hence; a new chapter

This chapter is going to be more “me.”

It's about 500 characters because 500 Words is surprisingly long…

But rather than 500 words or less, it'll be…somewhere around 500 characters.

It lowers the bar for me of minimum.

It aligns with application questions for jobs that have a character limit (word limits are slightly more difficult to code).

It's 3.6ish old-school Tweets, and ~2 new-school tweets.

## Keep on keeping on
