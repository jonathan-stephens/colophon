Tomorrow I start doing design work on a freelance contract for something I believe in.

They're making goal-based project management tooling for neurodivergent humans.

It's super cool.

## It started with a contact form

Sometime back in October 2023(?) I found all the Startups that received NC IDEAâ€™s investments. I went to each of the products and cole-messaged each startup via their site's contact form.

This was one of the very few that responded.

We've kept in touch since.

Lots of fantastic conversations with the CEO as I've wrapped my head around what they're doing.

I designed some for them for a project a months ago, looking to validate opportunities & have focused presentation materials.

## Good: people, product, and potential impact

It's a great trifecta.

Really looking forward.

Let'sa-go!
