Dek: The beauty of untranslatable words and the joy of gifted books

Text:

I’m an avid collector, and a lot of my collections are connecting to writing & reading. Scaling from the smallest to the spacious—fonts, words, posters, books, and series. We’re around the 600+ count mark of our home-library; it continues to grow.

Today, I’m sitting at my local co-working community, removing myself from my normal to consciously & purposefully read a new book.

It’s a gift from the company I’ve just started working with.

That fact excites me; hence today’s story.

## Defining tsundoku

Humanity has developed a fantastic diversity of communication and language, with over 7,000 spoken languages around the world.

**Fun fact:** There are thousands of untranslatable words that don’t have any direct equivalents in other languages.

**Sad fact:** we’re losing that diversity rapidly, with (link: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/01/languages-endangered-diversity-loss-spoken/ text: 1,500 languages at risk of being extinct by 2100).

Fun fact: Japanese has many of my favorite *untranslatables*, regularly highlighted by (link: https://www.instagram.com/susiedent/ text: Susie Dent) and (link: https://www.instagram.com/the.language.nerds/ text: The Language Nerds):

- *Shinrin-yoku:* forest bathing; an eco-therapeutic practice of walking in nature
- *Wabi-sabi:* an appreciation for the beauty of imperfection & impermanence in nature;
- *Ikigai:* someone’s sense of purpose and reason for being.

They’re beautiful, right?

Then…what’s *tsundoku?*

*Tsundoku* is when you’ve amassed a large collection of books. The `to-read` pile grows far more rapidly than the `have-read` pile, but you have the intent to read them…eventually.

## Ways of reading

When the CEO asked me how I preferred to read, I thought on the various scenarios and how I process information. There’s a myriad of ways to read books these days. For me, the format depends on the purpose of my reading the content.

- **Audio books works great when** I’m listening to something for fun, rest, relaxation, curiosity, etc. I don’t retain too much information if I solely listen to it.
- **Digital books works okay.** Reading long-form content on computer screens, tablets, or phones, are convenient but not preferred.
- **Physical books are my jam.** If I need to retain, reference, or research, the physicality of the book is essential. My memory access improves with visual stimuli, from even remembering that I have the book to associatively recalling its contents & lessons.

As my practice of reading has matured, becoming more purposeful & referential, I’ve enjoyed making marginalia—notes written in the page’s margins. My partner winces in pain everytime she sees me writing in a book; I’ve had to get over that feeling myself.

Marginalia is an exciting topic of book history that’s always fascinated me. I’ll write about (link: https://inpress.lib.uiowa.edu/feminae/DetailsPage.aspx?Feminae_ID=31987 text: nuns picking penises off a phallus tree) another day.

## Sharing the joy of reading

When I started in people management & leadership, I was given a few books:

- (link: https://bookshop.org/a/104898/9780787960759 text: Five Dysfunctions of a Team) by Patrick Lencioni;
- (link: https://bookshop.org/a/104898/9780307887894 text: Lean Startup) by Eric Reis; and
- (link: https://bookshop.org/a/104898/9781591846352 text: The Obstacle is the Way) by Ryan Holiday.

For readers, it’s a wonderful gift, contextualizing a leader’s context. Where are their thoughts these days? Who are they learning from, and what are they taking away?

The second day of working this new company, there was a new book at my front door.

[TO-ADD]

My left-hand wrist tattoo is visible, reading "be Kind" with a neurodiversity infinity symbol below it, custom with an ocean wave breaking from the top-left towards the center. The book shelf is filled with a broad selection of books and paraphernalia: topics of design, tech, ethics, branding, web development, graphic novels, CD's, linotype machine poster, and a plushy elephant in the bottom right.

I can’t communicate how exciting it is to start something new, with a new book!

Long story short…

## …yay books!
