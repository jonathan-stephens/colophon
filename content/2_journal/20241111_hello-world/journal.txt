Today, I'm getting the blog set up on my own website to start posting here. I'll set up an RSS feed as well, but this is an important step. I aim to be able to write from everywhere using my own CMS and all that fun stuff. This should also be the starting point for any automation things I want to do while syndicating content as I write. 

This will be the replacement for my current Substack: 500 Characters. I'll keep doing the Substack, but it's ready for it's next phase of evolution...
