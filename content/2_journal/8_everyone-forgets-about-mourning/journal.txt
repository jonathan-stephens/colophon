Dek: Understanding the cyclical nature of team development stages

Text:

In the world of team development, focus is often on developmental stages that propel us forward. But, there's a crucial phase that often gets overlooked—mourning.

This forgotten stage isn't just an afterthought; it's a vital part of the team's lifecycle, essential for processing change & blazing way for new beginnings.

Team development isn’t a linear process. It’s cyclical, closer to the changing seasons than a straight path. Each stage represents a unique season in a team's life, bringing its own set of challenges and opportunities.

## Development stages, briefly

- *Forming:* The team comes together for a purpose; a time of setting priorities and managing expectations.
- *Storming:* Together, members navigate conflict, learning what works, and what doesn’t.
- *Norming:* The team finds a rhythm, building group-specific rituals and trust.
- *Performing:* Everyone's in-sync, flowing productively & efficiently.
- *Mourning:* Change occurs, requiring reflection and adaptation.

## The importance of mourning

Mourning isn't just about loss; it's the transition period that allows teams to process change, internally and externally. It's the space where we ask, "What do we do now?"

When change occurs—someone leaving, a new person joining, finishing a project, or a shift in organizational structure—mourning gives the team space to:

- Process emotions and acknowledge the impact of change;
- Celebrate past achievements and learn from experiences;
- Explore new possibilities and potential directions;
- Adjust perspectives before diving into the next cycle.

Mourning provides that essential pause—the deep breath; before the plunge.

Feelings surface.

Perspectives shift.

By naming team's "seasons,” we create a shared language for growth and adaptation, ultimately cultivating more autonomously adaptive, high-performing teams.

## It’s not about speed

It's not about moving through these stages as quickly as possible. Each has its purpose and essential lessons of working individually together as one unit.

Mourning is the impactful bridge between what was and what could be. It prevents festering issues that could otherwise become toxic. It’s fertile soil where new ideas sprout, and stronger bonds can grow. So.

Next time your team faces change:

Don't rush to fix it.

Take a moment.

Adjourn.

Mourn.

Reflect on what’s been achieved, what y’all have learned, and how you've grown.

Then, step into your next cycle of development.

## It’s about the process

By honoring all stages of team development, we create resilient, adaptable teams ready to face whatever challenges come their way.

In the rhythm of life, mourning isn't an ending.

It's a beginning in disguise.
