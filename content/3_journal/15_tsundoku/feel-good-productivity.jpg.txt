Alt: A photo of me holding the book Feel Good Productivity by Ali Abdaal in my hand, in front of a book shelf packed with piles of books. My left-hand wrist tattoo is visible, reading "be Kind" with a neurodiversity infinity symbol below it, custom with an ocean wave breaking from the top-left towards the center. The book shelf is filled with a broad selection of books and paraphernalia: topics of design, tech, ethics, branding, web development, graphic novels, CD's, linotype machine poster, and a plushy elephant in the bottom right.
