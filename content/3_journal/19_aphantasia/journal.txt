One of the single, life-altering, most impactful facts I ever learned: people can see images in their minds!

Back in 2020, it was going viral on Twitter. I remember sharing this fact in pre-live-presentation chatter with (link: https://erindoesthings.com/about-erin-weigel/ text: Erin Weigel) and (link: https://sourcetxt.substack.com/about text: Kelly Mullins), “Did you know people can see things in their mind‽”

This is how I learned about aphantasia, or the inability to visualize in one’s “mind’s eye.”

## Aphantasia test

The viral tweeted test is simple. Close your eyes, picture an apple. Open your eyes, and—via the chart above—what most closely represents what you saw?

The amazing bit: people can actually see an apple as an apple just by thinking about it!

Meditation makes much more sense.

Throughout my off-and-on-again meditation practice, I never understood visualization inside one’s head is an actual ability humans have. (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56c1uL_O8Jk text: Headspace’s introductions to meditation) frequently used the “blue sky” metaphor that, conceptually, I understood…but had never imagined people could actually visualize these things.

## Visual problem-solving

Yesterday, I read a post that prompted today’s post. It was about how design is a tool for informed decision-making…visually.

> …we are talking about "using visuals to solve problems." This can mean UI, but often it means diagramming; making information understandable and actionable for decision-makers internally, rather than customers externally.<sup>1</sup>

Since learning this about myself, and the rabbit warren of self-discovery, I’ve come to the conclusion my aphantasia was one of the major factors that drove me into studying and becoming a professional designer.

## Convergence of design

I can’t visualize in any way, internally, so that visualization & thinking-process becomes external. Design has given me the tools to take that thinking to whiteboards, post-its, notebooks, mind-mapping.

To visualise; to communicate.

While I my ways of thinking diverges from statistical norms, design provides a process of convergence. Going through the process of giving form to function—and finding the function to form—is an essential part of my practice as a designer, manager, and leader. It’s one of the essential ingredients that has, I believe, contributed to my success and life-path thus far.

It’s also why I’m a photographer.

I’ve been taking photos since highschool: writing my final Senior Project on digital vs. film photography, saving up for my first DSLR, working at the University newspaper as a photographer, interning at a photography studio, even taking product shots of diamonds for a client.

I can’t recall memories in any way that’s visual. Photographs give me access to memories of the people & places I’ve encountered throughout life.

## Wired for design
Aphantasia is one of the prompting concepts that I plan to explore in a book: *Wired for Design, exploring the relationship between neurodivergence and design.*

I’ve yet to pin down if it’s a memoir or exploratory where I get to interview people or not.

If it sounds like a book you’d be interested in, let me know.
