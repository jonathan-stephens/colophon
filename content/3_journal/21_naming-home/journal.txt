Text:

The words we use give meaning that shapes how we think, live, and act.

How we name things holds even more power. 

## Moving Houses
One of my favorite things about moving house is the ability to re-name the home. It's a general, digital home security need that comes along with setting a new password. It's a new place so the wi-fi shouldn't remain the same. Also, fun—for me. 

## Hosting guests
There's additional need in Naming to make sure it's easy enough to share when someone asks what's the wi-fi and password. Needs to be easy to say; password, easy to write; that holds potential conversation sparks. 

## Tick the list
I have a deep appreciation for crossing things off a list—done, out of date, no longer needed...just added to be able to immediately cross off because document it's a thing that did get done but was more of an additional surprise. We can cross it off? Great. _There are limits but the general consensus in design and trying to get things done._

Writing it down and seeing as done also means that task is checked off for future-me to appreciate.

## Names as magic 
"For magic is in this, the true naming of a thing." My favorite Ursula le Guin quote from Merlin Book. By naming homes `$this` or `$that` we bestow something of what we hope that home to become. The energy, the vibes, you want to cultivate in _this_ Space. 

## Without further ado
And in a haphazard, chronological-ish order: 

### Atlantis
Our first home after moving to the States. New adventures, undiscovered cities. Also,a very good animated movie that's in our rewatch cycle. 

### Wonder Emporium
Our first apartment together. Named after one of my favorite movies: Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. Embodying the weird, fun, different ways of working at life. 

### The Burrow
My second apartment in Amsterdam's Jordaan. Named as a blessing to grow the warmth, community, safety, and solidarity in one magical red-headed family's home. A goal & hope to cultivate community and warmth in the space. 

### Caladan
My second apartment after University; my first in the Jordaan. If Arrakis was a new adventure, Caladan—another planet in the same literary universe—felt appropriate. A new land built of water and trade. 

### Vincent
_Couldn't name it because situation, but he was the street's namesake_ My apartment in De Pijp. One of my favorite artists. Even have a funny story of almost knocking a painting he did down by bumping into it.

### Arrakis
My first apartment after University, in Durham. A time of new adventures, "adult" life after graduation. A new world that's very different than any others I'd encountered so far.

> Note to Author: Add edit date for "Last Tended." Feb 14th. Current date becomes "Planted". When making this change in the code, "announce" change as to why. It's a digital garden practice. Stealing Maggie Appleton's microcopy. Love the metaphor.
