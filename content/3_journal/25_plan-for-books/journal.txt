Dek: Working through my site's URL design

Text:

There are quite a few different things I want to have surrounding `/books`. 

- I want it to be about the ones I'll write. 
- I want it to be about the ones I read. 
- I want it to be about the ones I recommend. 
- I want to tell stories about them. 

These are all valid, but difficult to encompass in a singular URL design that tends to represent one's own books. Especially in an author's context. 

But,
- what about a writer?
- what about a reader?
- what about a follower?

Both may imply levels of authorship or hot takes, but don't determine such. One can be an author but not a reader. I find it highly unlikely, but also believe humans have a vast capacity for hubris & ignorance that may have one believe, "I won't read others for fear of influencing my style & beliefs." 

Back to the point. 

This page should evolve into something. Just starting out with a basic bit. 

# Examples of potential posts
- Mrs Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (a few)
- Animorphs (many)
- Craft-focused
- Neurodiversity-focused
- Leadership-focused
- Climate-focused
- Dune 
- Hitchhikers Guide
- Art of Gathering

# Essentially...reviews. 
Basically, right. That means reviews. But `/reviews` in a "my website URL design" connotes reviews of my work, etc. Not reviews I've written.

Are stories reviews?
Are sparks fire?

I tend to read books, articles, posts, essays, and papers. More or less in that order. 

But they're all essentially different. 

# My site—my home.
From Naz's article this week, I'm making this for me. In the same way of building a digital garden: these are thoughts, spaces, etc. that I'm cultivating for myself, and for: reference, posterity, academia, and writer. 

## `/books` can be whatever I make of it. 
And that's the point. 

I like the idea of having it as a container for:
- my own
    - works in progress 
    - published
- recommendations
- stories 
- lists

It's part of my documentation I build and reference. 

## do `/essays` follow the same design?
No. 

Maybe?

Perhaps. 

That's my challenge. Designing a consistent thing from the onset versus a more emergent iterative evolution. 

From a structured mindset, and many different template types, the practicality of such a diverse structure- & style-base, maintenance & upkeep—there's a far greater benefit to KISS it. Keep it simple, stupid. 

Though I don't like the phrase as I age, it has a great acronym.
