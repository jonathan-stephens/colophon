Five years ago, (link: https://www.noidea.dog/about text: Tanya Reilly) introduced the concept of "(link: https://www.noidea.dog/glue text: Glue Work)" at (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KClAPipnKqw text: Lead Dev NYC), illuminating an often overlooked aspect of team dynamics. As I reflect on my career, I realize how profoundly this concept resonates with my experiences and working style.

Glue Work, as Tanya defined it, encompasses the essential behind-the-scenes efforts that hold projects and teams together. It's the connective tissue of our organizations, often invisible yet crucial for success. As someone who naturally gravitates towards this type of work, I've come to appreciate its unique challenges and rewards.

In my journey, particularly at growth-companies like Booking.com, I've found my neurodivergence serves as a valuable asset in environments that value versatility.

The ability to connect disparate ideas, facilitate communication, and spot opportunities for collaboration has been at the core of my contributions. However, I've also observed how the tech industry's shift towards specialization has sometimes overshadowed the value of generalists and Glue Workers.

Glue Work manifests in various forms, including:

- Onboarding new team members
- Facilitating cross-team communication
- Organizing knowledge-sharing sessions
- Identifying and addressing process inefficiencies
- Mediating conflicts and fostering a positive team culture
- Connecting seemingly unrelated ideas or projects

## The challenge of Glue Work lies in measurement

Traditional performance metrics often fail to capture its true impact, leading to underappreciation. It's through qualitative feedback and long-term outcomes that we can truly understand its value.

In continued reflection, I'm unsurprised by how Glue Work aligns with efforts in diversity, inclusion, and belonging.

By bringing together diverse perspectives and fostering an environment where all voices are heard, “glue people” create spaces for innovation and growth. This is particularly crucial in international teams, where cultural differences can either be barriers or sources of strength, depending on how they're navigated.

## The evolution of my career

Glue work is something that defines my career, and has followed me throughout life. From being a peer mediator in elementary school to facilitating complex cross-functional projects in tech, it’s the best name for the sort of work I do.

Each role has reinforced the importance of connecting people, ideas, and possibilities. It's a skill set that's been honed through practice and reflection, often learning as much from failures as from successes.

As our industry continues to evolve, it's crucial that we recognise and nurture the skills associated with Glue Work. While specialisation has its place, we must not lose sight of the immense value brought by those who excel at connecting, facilitating, and innovating across boundaries.

## How are different types of contribution valued?

I hope to have conversations about how we value different types of contributions in our teams. How can we create environments that appreciate both deep expertise and the ability to connect and synthesize? How do we measure & reward the invisible work that keeps our projects and teams cohesive?

Let's challenge ourselves to see beyond traditional metrics and appreciate the full spectrum of skills that make our teams successful.

When we do, we not only create more inclusive workplaces but unlock new potentials for innovation and growth.
