Part of my solar rotation celebrations was a commitment to study Spanish every day. I've kept up 77 days now on Duolingo which, for me, is quite an achievement. 

It makes me want to add on more things. 

## a skeet somewhere where someone asks if they tell time by the number of ChapSticks they use. 
This is what I call an anchoring discipline. 

For me, the Duolingo is now a measure of time that grows upon itself. It's a compounding habit that reminds of keeping it up. 

### Duolingo's messaging
While I enjoy so many aspects of the design, what I don't appreciate are the guilt trips with some of their push messaging & notifications. I can forgive the daily, random length video ads _and_ the relentless upselling. But the blatant emotional manipulation feels icky. 

Don't have an answer. Just daily observation. So while I do appreciate and enjoy the tool, some of these things glare out in practice. 

Wasn't there a deceptive design link I recently picked up? Let's see. Right: deceptive design patterns: https://www.deceptive.design/book#deck. Just launched a free thing. 

Question: what if I made an "ad" based website type of thing...but you actually made the ads for people you like. You put it in your "ad tool" and it's use the metadata to generate the ad. Could work really interestingly to be a like "RSS reader blog roll" as sort of thing to follow each other...but part of an ad network like a blog roll. 

## Chaotic Discipline
A new term I learned that beautifully summates my energies. Basically it's a fancy way of saying: go with the flow. 

Your individual flow.

Some days, and sometimes even _stretches_ of days, will come with good energy. Getting up, into your daily flow, easily, and continuing on.
