## Typographer `:not(`type design`)`
Something Eliot Jay Stock's new book gave light to, the recognition and clairty of what being a typographer means. It's not type design, though type design _is_ an aspect of typography in the larger craft.


## Writing and typography
Bringing order to chaos. That's the whole purpose of every single part of these topics. Order to the chaos of random human sounds into abstract shape to represent abstract words, with hundreds of variations of those sounds and shapes and ways of words of languages. 

- the shape and form of a symbol (define letter from a typography lens)
- the shape and form of unorganized thoughts into clearer
- giving that shape and form for future humans, even if its just yourself, the possibility of reading/learning.
