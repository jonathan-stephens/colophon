Dek: The Myth of 10x

----

Text:

From a conversation stemming from Katie Mack and Cat Hicks about the myth of the 10x engineer. 

Especially relevant with Hick's research. 

But the words that struck me in it: unlocking collaborative cycles. 

It's a super strong phraseâ€”poignant, precise, and aligns with how I work. With each cycle, what's needed to push things forward the best towards our shared goal. 

As a manager. As a leader. That's the direction I work. 

"Any blockers? Let's unblock them."
