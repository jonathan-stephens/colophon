Reflecting on my own life and my pursuit after understanding, for the first time, more of the why of both how and why I am the way I am.

I've come to realize I learn in seasons, and have periods where I'm super interested in something and learn. 

Develops info person tool sets for reflection, writing my own thing, understanding my neurodivergence, and my next season is going to be one reflection and action, through this newly discovered lens. I might as well take others along with me in my reflection. 

Seasons of learning is a way to categorize topics for my neurodivergent self. I'm wired for deep interest, and wired to move on. I'm wired for reflection, but need forward movement/growth that goes along with it. I use metaphors to explain the world, and find continued appropriateness in deepening our daily language connecting to the natures cycles. They're their for a reason.

All map to words of nature.

We have worlds within us.
Maps back to my Metaphoric Method idea. 

Naming the various seasons:

I myself am a product of nature's cool things, and I find that the more we encourage and more deeply explore to understand the wonderful complexity of existence, the better and more sustainably we can be. One necessary bit of understanding the world, is understanding who we are and how we can make our own world. Because the world wasn't designed for me, I have to actively push against the world to carve out my own niche.

I have to do it my own way, I have to do it with the depth of ethics/moral code instilled in me. As I encourage and help others do, whether it be through business, etc.Moving forward, i now have more tools to make sense of my own nature. This encompasses so many aspects of me to write on, it feels right. It also detaches ME from it slightly, building a different name recognition and something far more marketable/catchy. But, most importantly, my world, and our world, is changing so much btwn 2020-2022 and beyond, I want to take care of me first, and need to explore/reminders of the things most important to me, bit: changing the world starts within. 

I'm within the Earth's systems, and it's systems are a part of me.
