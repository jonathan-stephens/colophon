Found this through random work-related work. Super interesting to bookmark and use. Seems like it could also be a fun job to redesign, modernize, and work on this sort of tool to make it more usable for people. 

> "The United States Code is a consolidation and codification by subject matter of the general and permanent laws of the United States. It is prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel of the United States House of Representatives."

Also, just useful to know its existence & potential utility.
