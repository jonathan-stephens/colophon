> The smallest unit of learning is a feedback loop. Power is the privilege of not needing to learn. The dynamic process of life is best understood in relational terms. At human scale, all healthy relationships, independently of the level of intimacy, are characterised by the maintenance of de-powered dialogue – by a mutual deep desire to understand a precious living being.

> Ecologies are nested within each other, with the connecting lines between ecologies in the diagram representing inclusion, e.g. the human ecology includes household ecologies and the cellular ecologies that make up individual humans etc.

> Culture is co-created one trusted relationship at a time – this is the essence of fully appreciating diversity.

> De-powered dialogue is the atomic building block for the emergence of healthy relationships:
- Over the short-term, continuous de-powered dialogue allows us to learn more about each other.
- Over the mid-term, this results in a convergence towards shared understanding, and genuine appreciation of commonalities and differences.
- Over the long-term, it results in organic deepening of shared understanding based on growing numbers of shared lived experiences.
