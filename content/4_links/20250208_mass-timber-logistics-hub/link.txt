Very interesting article on designing a timber logistics hub that's just started construction in the Netherlands. 

> The design celebrates the area’s unique topography by nurturing the wetland and forest, alongside creating a constructed wetland habitat to support native species and microhabitats. A boardwalk with educational features will provide a scenic route for employees, while designated nature-only zones minimize human impact and preserve the existing environment.

> In an environment where both nature and people can thrive, we’ve also cultivated a rooftop meadow – spanning 30,000 m² – featuring planting beds, fruit trees, and blooming bushes.
