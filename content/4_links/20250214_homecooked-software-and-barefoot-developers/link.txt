Text:

> Home-cooked apps, like meals, are apps you make for the people you know and love.

> We’ve progressed enough since 2004 that someone can make one of these on their own.

> They’re simple – they require some skills, but not tons.

> They’re cheap or free to run – you’re not at the mercy of a corporate pricing strategy.

> You control what happens to them – you control whether features are added or removed, and whether they’ll be shut down or sunset.

- Private – won’t sell your data.
- Serve your specific needs.
- No financial pressure to monetize them or make a profit off them.
- Safe – very little risk of nefarious actors or misaligned incentives.
- Made with love and care.
