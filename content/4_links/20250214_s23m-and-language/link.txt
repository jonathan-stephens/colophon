Text:

A fantastic resource defining many different words through the following lenses:
- systems
- semantic
- logistic
- evolutionary
- ecological

Overall, it's about defining the Ecology of Care.

> The concepts of ***ecology*** and ***care*** are at the core of all journeys, reflecting an appreciation of ***diversity*** and ***interdependence*** as core values. Technically *de-powered human scale ecologies of care beyond the human* would be a good overall descriptor, since it indicates the overall direction of travel, but it is likely too long and obscure for those who are trapped in survival mode, who don't have the spoons to think beyond the immediate here and now.

> **The outlined approach offers a distinct entry point for all the marginalised and traumatised people who are ready for and genuinely committed to de-powering. We consistently replace "economics" (scarcity mindset) with ecologies of care (abundance and diversity mindset).**
