> Tools tend to exist between us and a goal, and the shape of the tool tells us something about how to proceed, and what outcomes are desirable. Tech *enacts* and *shapes* our world, our lives, and our politics.

> What are we going to build now â€“ those of us who still care about diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and giving consumers the power? Can we still put our HTML & CSS to good use? Can we get back to building a web where people have *agency* instead of *inhuman agents*?
