A wonderful link directory, harkening back to the early days of the internet. This is what I want to grow this `/links/` into but am doing it this way, one step at a time. 

I'm working from an emergent directory categorization standpoint. As I continue tagging all the links and posts, I'll look at the breakdown of all the things at a point in the future and re-vamp my `/links/` _or_ I'll get the jonathanstephens.link and populate accordingly.
