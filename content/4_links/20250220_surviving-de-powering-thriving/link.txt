> This article provides a synopsis of important ingredients, but it does not provide a recipe. The most appropriate recipe(s) vary greatly between contexts, and need to be discovered and refined through lived experiences in good company at human scale.

A beautiful explanation and framing of how to manage the experiential relationship of time and life, broken down into a "ingredients" format for the three central topics:
- **Surviving:** focusing on the here and now
- **De-powering:** focusing on the year(s) ahead
- **Thriving:** focusing on the seven generations ahead of us
