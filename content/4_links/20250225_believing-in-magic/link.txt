> this is for anyone having a hard time believing in magic, who also knows it is important to do so.
> so first, notice if you feel magical. if you do, just keep doing you. show others.
> if you don’t feel magical, open up. this may mean relinquishing some armor, dropping your shoulders, forgetting the gates of your heart. only you know where or if you are closed, i cannot tell you.
> it is all beyond your control. awe is the appropriate response to muster. feel that you are in a magical world that doesn’t even need your belief to work.
> remember: you don’t have to cultivate being magical, that is your default state, i know this from loving children. it is the default of every child i have ever ever met, and every human starts off in someone else’s hands just being a miracle.
> unlearn your disbelief, hold your cynicism loosely, and listen for the zing up your spine that let’s you know you are fully alive, in a magical world, in the only moment that exists.
