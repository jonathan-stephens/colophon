> ESII moves at the speed of trust, designing processes that get the right folks in the room to do the work that is most needed in these times. Step by step, we hold space for envisioning what that future could be and strategies for getting there.

## Core Principles
- Change is constant. (Be like water).
- Small is good, small is all. (The large is a reflection
of the small.)
- There is always enough time for the right work.
- Less Prep, More Presence.
- There is a conversation in the room that only these people at this moment can have. Find it.
- Never a failure, always a lesson.
- Trust the people. (If you trust the people, they become trustworthy).
- What you pay attention to grows.
- Move at the speed of trust. Focus on critical connections more than critical mass - build resilience by building relationships.
