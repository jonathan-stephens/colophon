A good article about `$title` but feels like the same bias against people from larger companies with assumptions about how people work:

> "...when we try to hire people from large companies, we sometimes see that people know very little outside their main role."

I've heard this directly from multiple CEO's in the North Carolina tech scene. Statements like, "I don't trust anyone from a big company" or "FAANG people don't know what hard work is" or "they're not willing to do the work that needs to get done."

I guess it comes from my own "tech upbringing" in the European "high tech" scene at Booking.com. The way we worked was so fundamentally different than the West Coast US Techâ€”complete with American Exceptionalism and its undercurrent of fascism. 

I digress.

Interesting article though.
