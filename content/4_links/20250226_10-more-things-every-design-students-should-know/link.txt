Text:

A wonderful presentation write-up from Cameron Moll that resonated deeply, at a time when I'm constantly—honestly, it's been a decade of doubt—trying to be a designer. I've been told so many times I'm not a designer, in many shapes, but all this is completely in line with how I work and my approach to design. 

*Extremely* validating. 

The headlines:

1. There is no definitive line between UI/UX.
2. Find your shape. 
3. Typography & type.
4. Dwell in the messy longer than you expect.
5. Process is a game. Play the game well.
6. You'll drive clarity from ambiguity more than anyone.
7. Done is better than perfect. Mostly.
8. It depends. 
9. Are you sure this is the right career path?
10. Be the light.
