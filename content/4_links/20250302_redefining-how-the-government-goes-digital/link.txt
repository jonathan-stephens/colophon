> Our goal is to collaborate, not compete, by bringing like-minded small to midsize companies together to work toward the common mission of serving the American public by improving how government works.

- **Community over credit**
Each win moves us all closer to digital transformation
- **Purpose over profit**
We’re mission-driven, not money-driven
- **Users over stakeholders**
If we don’t meet user needs, business goals will never truly be met
- **Innovation over risk management**
Change comes from taking chances
- **Outcomes over activities**
Success is what you accomplish, not how much you did to get there
- **Delivery over deliberation**
Perfection only exists once users tell you it’s perfect
