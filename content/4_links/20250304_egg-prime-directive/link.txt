On Bluesky, a thread introduced a new word to my lexicon that was quite interesting, Egg Prime Directive. It was in relation to the practice of telling neurodivergent people they are neurodivergent before they understand, realize, or know this about themselves. 

I looked it up for understanding the definition and found a wonderfully informative, helpful website with the definition. 

> My good friend Lily coined the phrase **“Egg Prime Directive”** to describe the fact that trans people have an unspoken agreement not to tell people who are questioning their gender whether or not they are trans.

> Finally, the entire purpose of being trans is self-assignment and self-actualization. Telling a person that they are trans is surely as coercive an assignment as what was done when they were born. If you want to help them figure themselves out, tell them about your life, tell them how dysphoria works, send them to this site, and give them ways to see how what they experience isn’t something that cis people live with.

Unless, of course, they ask you if you think they’re trans… then the prime directive no longer applies.
