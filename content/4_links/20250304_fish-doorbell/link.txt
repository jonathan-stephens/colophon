> Every spring, thousands of fish swim through the Oudegracht in Utrecht, searching for a place upstream to lay their eggs. But the Weerdsluis is often closed. You can help the fish continue their journey! If you see a fish, press the doorbell. This alerts the lock operator to open the lock.

A fantastic live stream built by the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands. There are so many random, interesting, cool civic projects in the Netherlands. This one's very fun.
