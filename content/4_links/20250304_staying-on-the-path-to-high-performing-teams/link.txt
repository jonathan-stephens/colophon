Text:

A nice alternative framework to Tuckman's Stages of Team Development that uses more accessible language.

- **Falling behind:** if each week, backlog is longer than the week before. Folks are working hard but not much progress, low morale, and users vocally dissatisfied.
- **Treading water:** able to get critical work done, but not paying down tech debt or start new things. 
- **Repaying debt:** starting to pay down tech debt, that was made from trying to catch up.
- **Innovating:** tech debt sustainable, higher morale, work is satisfying new user needs.
