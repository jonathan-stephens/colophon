Text:

> **Do not use `h1-h6` to mark up *Subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles and taglines* in `<hgroup>`, use `<p>` elements.**

Whether the semantics of the `<hgroup>` and the specifics of child `<p>` elements are to be conveyed to users is a decision for the assistive technology developers in consultation with their users. What browsers can and should do is ensure that unambiguous semantics are exposed in the accessibility tree.
