Text:

A text version, abridged, of Sophie Koonin's 2022/23 talk. It's wonderful, and in line with what I want to do with this website.

> If you take just one thing away from this article, I want it to be this: please build your own website. A little home on the independent web.

> So, once again my digital call to arms: build your own website. Make it fun. Make it pointless. But most importantly: make it **yours.**

Also finishes with a long list of "excellent personal and weird and wonderful websites" that were inspiration for the talk.
