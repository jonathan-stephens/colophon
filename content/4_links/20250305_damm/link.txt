> The Level Access Digital Accessibility Maturity Model (DAMM) is a clear and concise method for measuring the maturity of digital accessibility programs. Based on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), DAMM defines a working model to measure the degree of maturity a program has attained in implementing accessibility, using five levels of maturity to rate the current state of a program along seven dimensions.

- **Level 1:** Initial
- **Level 2:** Repeatable
- **Level 3:** Defined
- **Level 4:** Managed
- **Level 5:** Optimizing
