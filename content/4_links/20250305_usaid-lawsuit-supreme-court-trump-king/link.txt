Text: > Even so, for four of the justices, this is not enough. Under their theory, Trump should be unfettered: The budgets passed by Congress are meaningless, the contracts the government makes are meaningless, and the president’s whims can override anything contained within them. That’s not a president. That’s a king, and only a razor-thin majority kept the Supreme Court from crowing one.
