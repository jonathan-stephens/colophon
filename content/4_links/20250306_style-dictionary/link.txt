Text:

Very handy tool that I feel like I want to learn how to use and get going on. 

> Style Dictionary is a build-system that runs in both NodeJS and browsers (natively), to parse and transform your design tokens to then export them to any platform: iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML, sketch files, style documentation, or anything you can think of.

> Itâ€™s also forward-compatible with Design Token Community Group spec.
