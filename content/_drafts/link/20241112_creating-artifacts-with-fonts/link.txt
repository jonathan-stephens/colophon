Description: With Darden Studio merch being handed out for promotions at conferences and meetups, we wanted something that people could engage with. Something that would be visible and have utility. Pronoun pins were the perfect artifact to create for these events. We also wanted to create one pin, a spinner or slider, to accommodate different pronouns. After numerous iterations we broke down 3rd person subject pronoun into their parts and found we could make a slider that contained the letters “t”, “s”, and “y” on the back plate and “he” on the front plate, revealing different letters for each pronoun.
