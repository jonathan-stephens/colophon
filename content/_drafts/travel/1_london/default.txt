Title: London

Text:

In my travels, I've visited London a few times now. Here is a list of recommendations on where to travel, what to see, and what you can do in London. 

In terms of how to travel, I've found it best to find an area of the city, plan a few explicit places you want to go to, then explore inside that area.

In addition to what I'm writing below, here are a couple sites I usually do my research for interesting places and things to do while traveling:
- (link: https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london text: Lonely Planet)
- (link: https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/london-england text: Atlas Obscura)

Also, _always_ look around for Free Walking Tours around the cities! There's loads that occur, and the tour-guides are paid through the tips at the end. Here are some for London:

This is a fun place, and one of London's first crafts and antiques markets in an old builders yard. You can explore a massive maze of food, shops, and flea market in general.

Another market in a different part of town, the Greenwich Market is another multiply-hundred year old market (established 1737). It offers a diverse array of things to do—antiques, art, books, crafts, fashion, jewelry shops, etc—with loads of food and drink places. There are also (link: https://www.visitgreenwich.org.uk/greenwich-mean-time/ text: loads of interesting museums around), and it's just off the walk along the River Thames.

## Food
### Lanzhou Lamian Noodle Bar
This is one of the places I've been to many times, each trip to London. It's a delicious little dive of a noodle shop that has hand-pulled noodles. The broth is great, the noodles are great. It's a small shop but it's good for the price, filling, and good'n'warm for those cold days.

- **Website:** (link: https://lanzhounoodlebar.site/ text: https://lanzhounoodlebar.site/)
- **Address:** (link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/VaXiYUKhxvHTQ6dE6 text: 33 Cranbourn St, London WC2H 7AD, United Kingdom)

### The Hawksmoor
If you're looking for a good Sunday Roast, a traditional English Sunday sorta meal, The Hawksmoor was one of the best I've ever had. They have loads of locations across London. Make sure to get a reservation, as a just in case. It's absolutely delicious. Kitchen hours can be slightly different than your individual dining hours, so make sure to check all's well.

- **Opening hours:** ~11:45–21:00
- **Website:** https://thehawksmoor.com/
- **Locations:** (link: https://thehawksmoor.com/menus/ text: https://thehawksmoor.com/menus/)

### The Chesterfield Mayfair
This was recommended for one of the best afternoon tea's. A British Afternoon Tea is kind of an important cultural moment of the area. The place looks beautiful, with loads of nice treats and teas. You need a reservation. 

- **Opening hours:** 12:30–17:00
- **Website:** (link: https://chesterfieldmayfair.com/dining-and-drinks/afternoon-tea text: https://chesterfieldmayfair.com/)
- **Address:** (link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/DuhqGR1bnmrxX4KH7 text: 35 Charles St, London W1J 5EB, United Kingdom)

### Goddards at Greenwich
For a very good British pie, Goddards was recommended to me by a friend. I haven't been, but a pie is one of those British foods that are very good and worth the a try. This one's been open since 1890, so should have a good atmosphere and all. 

- **Opening hours:** 10:00–19:30
- **Website:** (link: https://www.goddardsatgreenwich.co.uk/ text: https://www.goddardsatgreenwich.co.uk/)
- **Address:** (link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/3HzgRsaoEug932Qj6 text: 22 King William Walk, Greenwich, SE10 9HU)

## Attractions
### Tower of London & London Wall
If you want to see a Medieval castle or Roman walls—while taking a step "back into Old London"—this could be a fun place to explore. The Tower of London has a rich history of political prisoners and such. It's also across the the river and a walk from the London Bridge and The Shard (if you want to have a high level view of London but don't want to go to the Eye, the Shard can be a potential alternative). 

- **Opening hours:** 09:00–16:30
- **Website:** (link: https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/ text: https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/)
- **Address:** (link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/mvsbYBijZWLAM8F97 text: London EC3N 4AB, United Kingdom)

### King's Cross
This is the central hub to a lot of travel by metro and in the center of London. It's also where you can find Platform 9 3/4 (and a shop). Don't be disappointed that it's not actually on the platforms. Line's are long. 

### London Zoo
It's fun. A good day out and walking around the area. Tons of interesting things. I traveled into the zoo by boat, and would highly recommend. You can pick up a ticket, see quite a bit of London from the view of the water, then walk right into the zoo without waiting in line. 

- **Opening hours:** 10:00–16:00
- **Website:** (link: https://www.londonzoo.org/ text: https://www.londonzoo.org/)
- **Address:** (link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/MpK9GQj6ASZVQ3347 text: Outer Circle, Regent's Park, London NW1 4RY)

### The London Eye
This is a nice visit. See London from high in the sky on a ferris wheel. Buy tickets in advance that can help you skip the line. Before and after, walk around the area and explore. The area has life throughout the day, but at night fun things pop up. It is **very much** a tourist attraction, and priced so. 

- **Opening hours:** 11:00–18:00
- **Website:** (link: https://www.londoneye.com/ text: https://www.londoneye.com/)
- **Address:** (link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/k2MyeZJsoUFdFEKi6 text: Westminster Bridge Road, Riverside Building, County Hall, London, GB SE1 7PB)

### Kew Gardens, Richmond
The Kew Gardens are a Royal Botanical Gardens with loads to walk around and see. Tons of nice flora, outdoor artwork, and nature to see. Nearby is the Richmond Park, a royal park that also has fields and you can find deer. Really pretty to see. About thirty minutes to an hour's transit away from Central London. I really enjoyed the science and learning of it all. Beautiful greenhouses too.

- **Hours:** 10:00–17:00

## Parks
If you want to chill a bit, or to get a good run in, there are many great parks around the city. You'll stumble across them, but you can also go more purposefully. I'm listing a few I've visited.
#### Hyde Park
- **Opening hours:** 05:00–00:00

## Interesting Unique Places
### God's Own Junkyard
This was recommended to me by a friend and a bit sad I've never visited. It's a 37-year grown collection of neon signs. It's only open on weekends, but it looks like a brilliant place to visit.

- **Opening hours:** 11:00–22:00 on Fridays and Saturdays; 11:00–18:00 on Sundays.
- **Website:** (link: https://www.godsownjunkyard.co.uk/ text: https://www.godsownjunkyard.co.uk/)
- **Address:**  (link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/X6hGfYpvg4g9Jt2C8 text: 12, Ravenswood Industrial Estate, Shernhall Street, London, E17 9HQ)

### Catacombs and Crypts of London
London is a multi-thousand year-old city. It's continually been built on top of the previous city. As a part of that, there are quite a few interesting places to visit where you can explore. They're all over, and not all are generally accessible to the public, but here are some places to get you started:
- (link: https://chislehurst-caves.co.uk/ text: Chislehurst Caves)
- (link: https://thelondonbridgeexperience.com/ text: London Bridge Experience' Tombs)

### Leake Street Arches
If you're looking for some fantastic street art, you can check out Leake Street. It's London's longest graffiti wall, made from connecting eight former railways beneath the Waterloo station. There're independent restaurants and bars to make an event of it. 

- **Website:** https://www.leakestreetarches.london/
- **Address:** It's a connecting route, so there are multiple ways to get there with no defined address. But they have great (link: https://www.leakestreetarches.london/gettinghere text: directions for getting there on their site).

### Forbidden Planet 
An absolute massive graphic novel and book store in Covent Garden. Since I found it, I plan ahead and pack fewer books to take with me whenever going to London...I tend to leave with four to ten books in hand. It's wonderful. 

- **Opening hours:** 10:00–19:00, Monday through Saturday 
- **Website:** (link: https://forbiddenplanet.com/ text: https://forbiddenplanet.com/)
- **Address:** (link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/82cL8uhZoxrQu7SV7 text: 179 Shaftesbury Ave, London WC2H 8JR, United Kingdom)

## Free Museums
There are many, _many_ museums around London. Luckily, quite a few of them are free to visit! They're concentrated in the area around the British Museum and Hyde Park. Just because they're free doesn't mean you don't need to book. Take a look at what they have around, then need to make a booking.
