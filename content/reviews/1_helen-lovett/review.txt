Review:

Jonathan was the manager I knew could exist but that I’d never had the chance to meet. He is a people person - who focused on delivering results by ensuring the people who reported to him felt safe, respected, heard and cared about. This was so much more powerful for the business, but more importantly, for the people around him, than some may realise.

Like pawns on a chess piece, he gently nudged each of us in directions that helped build our confidence and skills, while also contributing to a much bigger picture of how our place of work became exciting, inspiring, supportive and honestly, really fun to be in. His focus on bringing more women into the track made a huge positive difference to the atmosphere and conversations had by everyone. The ‘unicorn table’ helped those of us who worked with multiple teams to feel less alone and connect our crafts together. Moving people into teams that really suited their skill sets and ambitions made them so much more productive - and much happier in themselves. And the progress we made on our product in that time period was incredible.

Beyond our track, he made time and space for so many people who needed to talk about how they were feeling - helping to orchestrate huge changes to the way the company approached wellbeing - and that’s not even including his time within the WoCo.

He taught me that it’s ok - actually, really wonderful - to be myself in my work place. He helped me see that I have skills that I didn’t even know or understand were skills. He taught me that, in the words of Mark Twain, “it’s never wrong to do the right thing”. He taught me the incredibly important life lesson that sometimes it’s ok to ask for forgiveness instead of permission. He helped to teach me that we don’t always get it right but that’s also ok - it’s about owning it.

I know with a very deep certainty that he will have such enormous success in whatever he does next. Thanks for everything Jonathan :)
