Prose: This is a story. Not the full Pulse Story,  which I think could turn into a more essay side of things? But also a "focused portoflio piece" that could be a Call. to Action at the end of this. It's the one that has the most "meat" to it. But I was a tech/people manager throughout a lot of the time before focusing on pulse, where I become more involved in the product development & innovation.
